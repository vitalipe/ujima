  "Runs INSIDE the target chroot as root (and is the live `dev push desktop` deploy path). Stages
   the ujima *desktop* layer — its config files + assets — onto the base.

   SCAFFOLD: the desktop layer doesn't exist yet. This stages assets/desktop into /opt/ujima/desktop
   when that dir is present, and is otherwise a no-op. The graphical session's systemd unit will
   live in tools.scripts.ujimaify; runtime desktop *settings* (wallpaper, resolution, …) are the
   agent's job at runtime, not this build script.

   Pipeline: install -> base -> agent -> desktop -> ujimaify -> [dev] -> [cleanup].

   `project` is the read-only repo bind inside the chroot (default /ujima-src)."
